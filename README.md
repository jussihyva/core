The library is currently in an alpha stage. Not recommended for production use.

## Description

The Core library is a collection fast and useful tools to extend the standard C
functionality.

## Objectives

-	User friendly interfaces.
-	Fast and reliable.
-	Minimum side effects.
-	Explicitness rather than compactness.
-	Readable and well documented source code.
-	Modular abstractions.
